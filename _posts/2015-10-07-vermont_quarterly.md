Old news, but I just wanted it here as a reference:

My famous quote:
<i>“Here she is!” shouts Nguyen, chasing a larger ant with tweezers. “Here’s the queen. She’s trying to hide, but she has a big butt.” They pop the animal into a clear plastic bottle, and scoop a swarm of worker ants into a Tupperware.</i>
