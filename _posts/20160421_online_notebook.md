#Species responses to climate change project

### Author: ANTdrew D. Nguyen


## Question:

* What allows some species to persist in a warmer climate better than others? What are the factors that determine resiliency or susceptibility?

## Hypothesis:

* More resilient species can cope better with heat stress.

## Experimental approach:

* Challenege different species with heat stress to identify resilient and suseptible ones.

## Prediction: 

* More resilient species **will** have elevated shifts in their thermal performance.
