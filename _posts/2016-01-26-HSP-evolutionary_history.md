title: "What is the evolutionary history of critical stress proteins in ants?"
date: 2016-01-26

Even though ants have colonized almost every continent on Earth except antarctica, 
little is know about how they cope with these thermally stressful environments at the molecular level. Thankfully, there has been a lot of work in model systems such as fruit flies, worms, yeast, etc, that have characterized proteins criticalfor coping with heat stress, known has heat shock proteins (Hsps). Hsps turn on in almost the same way, whether you're a fruit fly, worm, or yeast too!

Therefore, a priori, I expected these proteins to be important for ants and thankfully, many ant genomes as well as other Hymenoptera are now publicly available, allowing me to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Hsps. I found that within the insects, there have been a lot of gains and losses, similar to how species diversify or become extinct. And this process produced a unique set of Hsps in ants and other Hymenoptera that turn on in response to temperature stress.
