Many students in the UVM biology department are interested in making maps, which can be done in R. So I'm sharing a [dataset]({{http://adnguyen.github.io}}/assets/Coordinates_Sites.csv) and [Rmarkdown]({{http://adnguyen.github.io}}/assets/Yai_map_precip.Rmd) script (here is the [html output]({{http://adnguyen.github.io}}/assets/Yai_map_precip.html)).

Basically, all you need to make a map is R + Rstudio and a csv file with coordinates (lat and lon). 
And...you get this!
