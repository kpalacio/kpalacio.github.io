	<p>About me: I was not always fascinated by the natural world. As a kid, I'd play outside for hours and hours but I never noticed nature's beauty. This continued through college (Drexel University) until I took an Evolution course (with an awesome <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kenneth_lacovara_hunting_for_dinosaurs_showed_me_our_place_in_the_universe">professor!</a>) that helped me appreciate biological diversity and how evolutionary processes can shape that diversity. In this course, I learned: how some species are more altruistic towards relatives than strangers because they receive indirect fitness benefits, how male peacocks are showy because of female preferences, how one of Earth's largest experiments in body plans was during the Cambrian explosion, how we can visualize diversity through phylogenetic trees, and how genes trees can go through births and extinctions just like species tree, how we(tetrapods) are all fish! Up until this point, I was used to learning about the intricate molecular pathways that underly the characteristics of cells, which I found fascinating too. I knew I was destined for a lifetime of learning all of life's intricacies which led me to this problem: I was interested in everything and would need to narrow it down for a PhD.</p>
	<p>Before deciding on a PhD program, I worked a few years so I could brood on my research interests. In the biotech industry, I learned how to clone genes and express it in a cell lines with the goal to develop an anti-bioterror agent for one project, and another one focused on developing a therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. I got to play with cool machines such as a fluorescence activated cell sorter! Basically, you can shoot lazers at cells and you can tell the machine to separate it out. Although I enjoyed my job, I was still fascinated by the larger evolutionary story which was missing in my daily life. And then I thought, why don't I combine my interests with my existing talents? I figured that I needed to find a good study system where I could learn as much biology as possible from the genes to ecosystems.</p>
	<p>It turns out, ants are a good model to explore almost all questions in biology from genes to ecosystems because many genomes are now available, they're social, and they provide critical ecosystem services. I only realized this fact when the first <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5995/1068">ant genomes were published in 2009 </a> and opened the door for ants to be a nice genetic model for complex social behavior. This paper (and also subsequent ant genome papers) and reading <a href="http://www.alexanderwild.com/">Alex Wild</a>'s blog, which shows the incredible social behaviors and diversity of ants, led me to explore them in nature. I began to bait for ants to see which kinds showed up. Why were some kinds in certain places and not others? I looked at them under the scope and entered a whole new world! Nature does exist outside a test tube. :-)</p>
	<p>I'm now in my 5th year as a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/">University of Vermont</a>. For my dissertation, I'm determining how temperature acts as a selective force on ant characteristics from where they live (abundance and distribution) to how they function at the physiological and molecular level. </p>
